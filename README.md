# QPGen

This was our IT150 Object Oriented Programming Project for our college NITK Surathkal

### The Idea
Research has it clear that us humans cannot do things which are supposed to be random, randomly enough. We cannot wirte a perfectly random string of 0's and 1's. We use a computer to make random binary strings, and that has become the bedrock of modern cryptography: the ability of a computer to generate completely random strings.

We are college students: we realised that even teachers cant randomly select questions from a particular chapter. They tend to ask from those questions which look obviously important.

### About the Program
We used Java and MySQLLite to make the program. This is a Console Java Program.
